This folder contains existing linear bandit algorithm in literature. 

Algorithms are inplemente by myself following corresponding paper. 

The list of algorithms is: 

LinRel, SupLinRel, LinUCB, SipLinUCB, LinTS, E-greedy, Giro, LinPhe, Phased Elimination, LSE, UCB-GLM, SupCB-GLM, SpectralEliminator
